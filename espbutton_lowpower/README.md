This is a low power implementation of my espbutton sketch. This effectively sends the ESP to deep sleep once HTTP(S) request is completed. Reset pin of ESP needs to be pulled low in order for the ESP to wake up from deep sleep. This can be achieved by a button connected to ground and then to reset pin of ESP. When the button is pressed, ESP wakes up, performs the setup routine including Wifi connection and HTTP(S) request. Then the ESP is sent to deep sleep mode. This saves a lot of power since the button press on the reset pin effectively acts as "the button". With this setup, an ESP-01 module can be run for a few weeks on battery power (2 x AA batteries), based on my observations. I haven't performed detailed calculations yet.
